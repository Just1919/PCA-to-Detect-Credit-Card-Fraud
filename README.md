# PCA-to-Detect-Credit-Card-Fraud

This project offers an alternative approach to credit card fraud detection, using PCA-based anomaly detection rather than supervised learning. It identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and detecting anomalies in the data.
The dataset used is available on Kaggle and contains data on bank transactions, including details such as the amount, time, and anonymized columns V1 to V28, which were generated using PCA.
